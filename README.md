Well I've broken it. It was working but I couldn't leave well enough alone. Thankfully I have older versions. \o/
The newer version has a lot of updates for validation and duplicate prevention, but it's broken because for some reason it doesn't want to post to the server correctly. I've spent well over 10 hours coming and editing and I can't find the cause so I give up. It will just have to be.
